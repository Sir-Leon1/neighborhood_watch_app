## Overview

The **Neighborhood Watch App** allows residents in a community to monitor and report suspicious activities, incidents, and other security concerns. It provides an intuitive user interface for managing incidents, users, and roles, while also offering real-time notifications for emergencies.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration features, allowing users to create accounts and log in to the app.
- **Incident Reporting**: A feature to report incidents such as suspicious activity, vandalism, or emergencies.
- **User Management**: Admins can manage user roles, assign privileges, and view the activity dashboard.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive instant notifications about urgent incidents in the area.
- **Settings & Configurations**: Users can configure personal settings, and admins can manage global app configurations.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (version 6.x or higher)
- React (version 17.x or higher)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/neighborhood-watch-frontend.git
cd neighborhood-watch-frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory to configure the environment variables.

Example:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server. By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Key Directories:

- `public/`: Contains static files such as `index.html`, the app’s entry point.
- `src/assets/`: Contains images, fonts, and other static resources.
- `src/components/`: Reusable components like buttons, modals, and forms.
- `src/pages/`: Page components that represent full views like Home, Dashboard, or Incident pages.
- `src/services/`: API service files that handle HTTP requests to the backend.
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks to share logic across components.
- `src/contexts/`: React Contexts to manage global state (e.g., AuthContext, NotificationContext).

---

## Configuration

You can configure the app using environment variables defined in the `.env` file:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL for the backend API.
- `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`: The base URL for the WebSocket server (for real-time updates).

---

## Usage

### Running the development server

To start the frontend application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. It automatically connects to the backend API using the `REACT_APP_API_URL` defined in your environment variables.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
- **`npm run test`**: Runs the unit tests using Jest.

---

## Testing

The frontend includes unit and integration tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**. To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Coverage

To check the test coverage:

```bash
npm run test -- --coverage
```

This will generate a report on how much of the code is covered by the tests.

---

## Deployment

The frontend can be deployed using several methods, including **Docker**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**. Here's an example deployment with Docker:

### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t neighborhood-watch-frontend .
```

### 2. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 neighborhood-watch-frontend
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, for serverless deployment:

- **Vercel**: Use the Vercel CLI or connect the GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployment.
- **Netlify**: Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for seamless deployment.
